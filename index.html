            A devoted son or daughter respects and obeys their parents, fulfills their expectations, and takes care of them in times of need.

          <div class="answer">

          <div class="answer">
            The author humorously presents the ignorance of the villagers by showing how they used “America” and “the USA” as if they were two different places. Their confusion reflects their limited knowledge of the outside world.

            Rakesh’s wife, Veena, is portrayed as a simple and traditional woman chosen by his parents. She is not highly educated or fashionable, but she is dutiful, obedient, and adjusts well into the family. She represents the typical daughter-in-law of a middle-class Indian household.

          <summary><span class="qnum">8</span><span class="qtext">Why did the old man try to bribe his grandchildren?</span></summary>
          <div class="answer">
            The old man, Varma, tried to bribe his grandchildren with money so they would secretly bring him the sweets and fried foods that Rakesh had forbidden. He longed for these small pleasures of life, even though they were harmful to his health, because he felt deprived and unhappy under his son’s strict diet control.

          <summary><span class="qnum">9</span><span class="qtext">Are Mr. Varma’s complaints about his diets reasonable? How?</span></summary>
          <div class="answer">
            Yes, Mr. Varma’s complaints are reasonable to some extent. Although Rakesh’s restrictions were for his father’s health, they made him feel deprived of joy and freedom. At his old age, emotional satisfaction and happiness were as important as medicine. Hence, his dissatisfaction with the strict diet was natural.

          <div class="answer">
            The Varma couple worked hard and lived a very simple life to educate Rakesh. His father, though an illiterate vegetable seller, saved money with great effort, and his mother managed the household frugally. They gave up their comforts and ambitions so that Rakesh could pursue higher education and become a doctor.

          <div class="answer">
            Yes, he might have enjoyed better health if his wife had not died before him. She was his emotional support, companion, and caretaker. Her presence could have reduced his loneliness and provided him comfort, which might have improved his mental and physical well-being. Her absence made him feel neglected and more vulnerable to illness.

          <div class="answer">
            Besides giving medical treatment, Rakesh could have paid more attention to his father’s emotional needs. He could have allowed his father occasional small pleasures like sweets or fried food in moderation, listened patiently to his feelings, and shown more affection. By balancing medical care with emotional comfort, he could have made his father’s final years happier and more peaceful.

          <div class="answer">
            The story shows a loving and playful relationship between the grandfather and the grandchildren. Mr. Varma, despite his poor health, enjoyed their company and even tried to bribe them with money to get sweets and fried food secretly. This shows the bond of affection and trust between generations, but also highlights his craving for freedom against Rakesh’s strict control.

          <summary><span class="qnum">14</span><span class="qtext">Do you call Rakesh a devoted son? Give reasons.</span></summary>
          <div class="answer">
            Yes, Rakesh can be called a devoted son because he respected his parents, fulfilled their dreams by becoming a doctor, and cared for his father in old age. However, his devotion sometimes became over-controlling, as he focused only on physical health and ignored his father’s emotional needs. His devotion was sincere, but it lacked balance between love and strictness.

          <summary><span class="qnum">15</span><span class="qtext">Medicines replace our diets in old age. What can be done to make old age less dependent on medicine?</span></summary>
          <div class="answer">
            Old age can be made less dependent on medicine through healthy habits and supportive care. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can keep the body strong. Regular exercise such as walking or yoga helps prevent many diseases. Emotional support from family members reduces stress and loneliness, which also improves health. Preventive health checkups can help in early detection of problems before they become serious. Finally, involving elderly people in light activities, social groups, and hobbies keeps them active and happy.
